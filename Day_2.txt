*** 5 Phases of Ethical Hacking ***

#Phase 1: Reconnaissance(Collect Data)

          The first phase is Reconnaissance, where hacker gather as much information as possible about the target.

          Ex:Open-source intelligence(OSINT), WHOIS Lookup, DNS Enumeration, Google Dorking and Social Engineering.

#Phase 2: Scanning(System Scanning)

          Here, hacker find vulnerabilities in the targeted system using tool like Nmap and Nikto!

          Ex: Nmap --> Network Scanning         
              Wireshark --> Packet analysis
              Nikto --> Web Server Scanning

#Phase 3: Gaining Access(Exploitation)

          Hackers try to enter the system using SQL Injection, Phising, or Exploits!

          Ex: Weak Password Exploitation,        
              SQL Injection, XSS,
              Phising Attack

#Phase 4: Maintaining Access(Backdoor Setup)

          Once inside, hacker wants to maintain access!
          They use Backdoors, Rootkits, or Trojans to keep the door open for future attacks!

          Ex: Metasploit Backdoor,         
              Netcat,
              Reverse Shell

#Phase 5: Covering Tracks(Remove records )

          In the final step, hackers cover theri tracks - erasing logs, deleting IP traces, So no one can catch them!

          Ex: Shred --> Secure file deletion
              CCleaner --> Log cleanup
